NOTE: Please RSVP on our our Facebook page if you are planning on attending our meetings.

RSVPs are strongly encouraged that so if cancellation is necessary, attendees can be notified.

We have a very active Facebook community that families can also join. At this time, our chapter has a very limited availability to provide home visits. We are happy to assist families by phone, email, Facebook, and at our monthly meetings.
